I'm many things: data scientist, environmental engineer, son, brother, Brooklynite, runner, and trivia enthusiast. My specialties are understanding complex systems, especially involving energy & material flows, then developing reproducible models of them and turning results into actionable findings. I'm also motivated to mentor data scientists and grow organizations' analytic abilities.

Professionally, I'm a multi-lingual analyst with domain expertise in energy efficiency, data science, and program evaluation. I have consulted for energy & utilities clients, written peer-reviewed papers, and helped to grow analysis teams using R & Python.

My academic background is in physics, environmental engineering, and Spanish. Outside of coursework, I have also learned how to be a skilled educator, mostly by listening and being attentive to how others learn.
