I'm many things: data scientist, environmental engineer, son, brother, Brooklynite, runner, and trivia enthusiast. 

Professionally, I'm a multi-lingual analyst with domain expertise in energy efficiency, data science, and program evaluation. I have consulted for energy & utilities clients, written peer-reviewed papers, and helped to grow analysis teams using R & Python. My specialties are understanding complex systems, developing reproducible models, turning results into actionable findings, and mentoring data scientists.

My academic background is in physics, environmental engineering, and Spanish. Outside of coursework, I have also learned how to be a skilled educator.
