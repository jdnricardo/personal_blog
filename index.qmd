::: {.bio-content}
I'm many things: a data analyst and full-stack software developer, an environmental engineer with a passion for climate and energy, a Brooklynite, runner, and trivia enthusiast. Seeking the deep satisfaction of building and maintaining things that last, while simultaneously empowering others to learn and grow.

Growing up with a patternmaker and architect for roommates, I have a strong appreciation for craftsmanship, durable design, and the meticulous process of creating well-structured, resilient solutions. This perspective naturally resonates with my work in energy and material flows, where understanding and modeling complex systems for lasting impact is paramount.

Professionally, I specialize in translating complex data and systems into actionable insights and robust applications. I am a multi-lingual technologist proficient in production Python, TypeScript, React, and modern front-end tooling (Tailwind, shadcn), built upon a foundation in data science (R & Python). I have experience consulting for energy & utility clients, contributing to peer-reviewed research, and have a proven track record in mentoring technologists and growing organizations' capabilities â€“ a drive fueled by my core identity as an educator and a belief that spreading best practices builds stronger teams and more sustainable products.

My academic journey in physics, environmental engineering, and Spanish has provided a unique lens through which I approach problem-solving. Outside of formal coursework, I've honed my skills as an educator by being attentive to how others learn, always seeking to foster shared understanding and empower those around me.
