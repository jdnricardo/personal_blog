Surprise! Not every post will involve diving into code, for various reasons:

- I need to work on writing about other topics
- Potential employers need to know I'm not replaceable even if AI takes over all coding responsibilities
- I contain multitudes!

I'm starting off with a compilation of articles, reports, etc. that I have contributed to academically or professionally. I suppose no matter what it's a selfish exercise to take on, but especially as a consultant, not everything I wrote, analyzed, etc. ended up with my name attached to it. This way I can at least assemble all (or most!) of the relevant links in one place.

Starting things off strong, I wrote an [article](https://digitalshowcase.lynchburg.edu/jaupli-b/vol3/iss1/1/) about modeling volleyball spin and the Magnus effect while I was an undergraduate physics student.
