A really quick post to shoutout the open-source libraries I used to create what I find to be gorgeous icons, e.g. the favicon I use for my website, reproduced above in a larger size.

-   [boringavatars](https://boringavatars.com/){target="_blank"}
-   [coolors](https://coolors.co/palette/fb6107-f3de2c-7cb518-5c8001-fbb02d){target="_blank"}

Anybody who worked with me previously will now know my secret to creating cute, company-themed user icons ðŸ˜‹

```         
import Avatar from 'boring-avatars';

<Avatar 
        name='Julian do Nascimento Ricardo'
        size='180'
        variant='sunset'
        colors={['#FB6107', '#F3DE2C', '#7CB518', '#5C8001', '#FBB02D']}
/>
```
