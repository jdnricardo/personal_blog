## Assembling the tools

This post is the third in a series exploring the DOE's [Eagle-I dataset](https://openenergyhub.ornl.gov/explore/dataset/eaglei_outages_2014/information/){target="_blank"} on US electrical grid outages. See previous posts here: [I](../intro/index.html){target="_blank"} and [II](../eia_metrics/index.html){target="_blank"}

I gave away in my previous post that I had drafted numbers to compare with the EIA for a few states.

![](../eia_metrics/sample_saidi_state.png){fig-alt="Console output in R showing the calculated SAIDI metric for an assortment of US states"}.

 They did not match the EIA chart (see below), but were reasonable enough for me to justify making more-polished visualizations. In more words, "reasonable" given just the uncertainties in data sourcing I already know about, let alone the Rumsfeldian unknowns lurking about. Before testing my ~~hubris~~ hypothesis that I've replicated anything worth posting about...

A few caveats:

- I am comparing numbers with the set from the EIA that *includes major events*, to avoid coming up with independent estimates of when these events occurred in the Eagle-I data, merging that data in somehow, etc.
- I am comparing numbers with numbers I am reading off of the EIA chart, rather than coming up with my own aggregated state numbers from their underlying utility-level spreadsheet. That is an exercise for another day
- I did not run the Eagle-I analysis on all 50 states, ~~because I'm impatient~~ to save computation time. I ran only the 8 states labeled in the EIA chart: Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, West Virginia.

Last bit before jumping into the charts... my setup chunk, where I load packages, set my `ggplot2` theme, and assemble the necessary targets (i.e. datasets I produced in my pipeline). For colors, I'm using reds from [Reasonable Colors](https://www.reasonable.work/colors/red/) today.

```{r setup}
library(targets)
library(tidytable)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext)
library(ggrepel)
library(scales)

theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +
            theme(panel.grid = element_blank()))

tar_load(matches("sai[df]i"), store = "../_targets")

median_tag <- "<span style = 'color:#530003;'><strong>US median*</strong></span>"
median_red <- "#530003"
base_red <- "#FF4647"
```

## Spoiler alert

I managed to create a chart that looks like what I was after! Recall the chart we started with, from this EIA [article](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=54639){target="_blank"}. The two metrics I'm interested in replicating from the chart are System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI, horiz. axis) and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI, vert. axis).

![](../intro/chart2.svg){fig-alt="Average total annual electric power interruption duration and frequency per customer, by state, for 2021 only"}

What's below is only a draft, for reasons I'll get into with the remainder of this post.

```{r}
inner_join(
  state_saidi,
  state_saifi,
  by = "state"
) %>% 
  bind_rows(
    data.frame(
      state = "US median*",
      # Technically, they say "just over seven hours" so I added 5% to SAIDI.
      # SAIFI is interpreted from graph
      saidi = 7*1.05,
      saifi = 1.4
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    state = fct_reorder(state, saidi)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = saidi,
             y = saifi)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = state == "US median*"),
             size = rel(4),
             alpha = 1/1.5) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(color = state == "US median*",
                      label = state)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(base_red,
                                median_red)) +
  expand_limits(x = 0,
                y = 0) +
  labs(title = paste("States' SAIDIs & SAIFIs compared to the", median_tag), 
       caption = "*including major events") +
  guides(color = "none") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line("grey90"),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        title = element_markdown(size = rel(0.8)))
```

## Total annual outages

I will start off comparing my SAIDI with the EIA's median value of "just over seven hours", translated by yours truly to 7.35 (or 5% higher). Louisiana catches the eye, being so far out at 50+ hours. But that's not as far adrift as it is in the EIA data, at 80+ hours. Maine has the lowest SAIDI in my analysis and the EIA's (you go Maine!). Most states in my analysis are above the EIA median, as I expected. But on closer inspection, it's by smaller margins than I want to see before closing out this analysis. Kentucky is above-median according to the EIA and below-median if you look at my analysis.

```{r}
state_saidi %>% 
  bind_rows(
    data.frame(
      state = median_tag,
      # Technically, they say "just over seven hours"
      # so I added 5%
      saidi = 7*1.05
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    state = fct_reorder(state, saidi)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = saidi,
             y = state)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = state == median_tag)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(base_red,
                               median_red)) +
  labs(caption = "*including major events") +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line("grey90"),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(),
        axis.title = element_blank())
```

![](./images/state_saidi-1.png){fig-alt="Bar chart showing state SAIDI values as calculated from Eagle-I data, compared to the EIA median value."}

I will need to take another look at my approach to calculating SAIDI, and have a sneaking suspicion I need to handle missing chunks of the time-series better.

I should also check how the distribution of SAIDIs in individual counties held up, to better understand how I'm calculating right-tail outcomes especially. Right on time, a wild violin chart appears! The lines in each violin indicate the median SAIDI among a state's counties, as well as the 5th / 95th SAIDI percentiles.

This helps my self-esteem a little bit. Maybe I have moderately, but not egregiously, underestimated the largest and/or longest outages? Still, look out for revisions to the SAIDI calculations in a future post!

## Number of outages

Showing the same charts, but now with SAIFI rather than SAIDI. Other than Louisiana coming in **above** the EIA estimate, I can summarize everything else as worse than my SAIDI analysis in replicating the EIA estimates. The SAIFI values I came up with are lower than the EIA's state-level estimates. Most notable are the many state SAIFI estimates that come in lower than the EIA median... a clearer sign that more work is needed here.

## Next steps

Setting aside whether or how much I can mitigate uncertainty due to using census population figures (and not utility customer figures), I feel confident there is room to tighten up my SAIDI and SAIFI calculations with a closer review of them. Along the way, I plan to develop additional charts to quantify the discrepancies I find.

Ideally, I would also show the above charts alongside the *actual* EIA values for each state / county, and not just the overall median value as derived from visually interpreting their published chart. It's not exactly a sturdy foundation for comparative analysis...

Firming this up will require reading in & manipulating data the EIA publishes on utility reliability (in spreadsheets named "Reliability.xlsx" for each calendar year). From a quick glance, the reliability files allow for taking a weighted average SAIDI / SAIFI for each state, using the "Number of Customers" column as the weight. Stay tuned for this update as well!

To cap things off, I would like to conjure up interactive visualizations of my Eagle-I analysis (and comparisons to the EIA figures), maybe with the `ggiraph` package.
