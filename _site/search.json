How exciting!\nThis is my place to get thoughts on the page, primarily in the realms of energy systems and data science. It’s also a place to showcase the skills I’ve sharpened as a professional, and mess around with tools I’d like to add to my toolset.\nThis is also a place to start paying forward the knowledge sharing I benefited from at NMR Group, where I cut my teeth as an analyst, data scientist, and eventually as a mentor to folks starting their professional journeys in R and/or in data science."

    "text": "I’m many things: data scientist, environmental engineer, son, brother, Brooklynite, runner, and trivia enthusiast. My specialties are understanding complex systems, especially involving energy & material flows, then developing reproducible models of them and turning results into actionable findings. I’m also motivated to mentor data scientists and grow organizations’ analytic abilities.\nProfessionally, I’m a multi-lingual analyst with domain expertise in energy efficiency, data science, and program evaluation. I have consulted for energy & utilities clients, written peer-reviewed papers, and helped to grow analysis teams using R & Python.\nMy academic background is in physics, environmental engineering, and Spanish. Outside of coursework, I have also learned how to be a skilled educator, mostly by listening and being attentive to how others learn."

    "text": "This post attempts to replicate stock analysis with the coreStatsNMR package, available via the NMR Group r-universe. Specifically, using the statsTable function outlined in this post.\nFirst, downloading the library using the custom repos argument to point to the r-universe: install.packages(\"coreStatsNMR\", repos = c(\"https://nmrgroup.r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\n\nlibrary(coreStatsNMR)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'coreStatsNMR'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:base':\n\n    mode\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nstatsTable(data = iris,\n           summVar = \"Sepal.Length\",\n           groupVar = \"Species\",\n           stats = c(\"n\", \"min\", \"max\", \"mean\", \"weighted.mean\", \"median\", \"sd\", \"iqr\", \"cv\"),\n           accuracy = 0.01,\n           drop0trailing = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\nWarning in statsTable.data.frame(data = iris, summVar = \"Sepal.Length\", : Using placeholder weights of 1 for all data\n\n\n\n\n\nstat\nsetosa\nversicolor\nvirginica\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nn\n50\n50\n50\n150\n\n\nmin\n4.30\n4.90\n4.90\n4.30\n\n\nmax\n5.80\n7.00\n7.90\n7.90\n\n\nmean\n5.01\n5.94\n6.59\n5.84\n\n\nweighted.mean\n5.01\n5.94\n6.59\n5.84\n\n\nmedian\n5.00\n5.90\n6.50\n5.80\n\n\nsd\n0.35\n0.52\n0.64\n0.83\n\n\niqr\n0.40\n0.70\n0.67\n1.30\n\n\ncv\n0.07\n0.09\n0.10\n0.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what?\nYay! We can run summary statistics on stock R data with our own package. Why do this? We already can write expressive pipelines with various packages: dplyr, data.table, collapse, or polars. The added value of a DIY function is not apparent, especially if it’s using those packages underneath.\nHowever, for a consulting firm, such as my previous employer, there is value in creating wrapped versions of the stock coreStats functions which incorporate project/client constraints and documentation. That way, the core functions’ focus can be on being very good in a narrow scope (for each function), but they can be combined and/or extended via wrappers for projects and/or specific, repetitive applications. This does assume time is invested in designing them to play nicely with one another, and maintaining these conditions as the codebase evolves. Having shareable “core” functions separate from “project code” allows the firm to tap into additional marketing value as well, i.e. more-visibly participating in open-source software (OSS) development.\nInternal and/or public packages are also ways to embed invaluable organizational knowledge, e.g. in a package’s testing suite, warnings, errors, and documentation. Of course, embedding this knowledge requires caution so that only the sources/methods/etc appropriate for public use are exposed in public repos like the r-universe."
